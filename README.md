# Tabla Taal Recognition System

The Tabla Taal Recognition System is a research project that explores the categorization of Classical Indian Music Tabla Taals, including renowned ones such as Addhatrital, Ektal, Rupak, Dadra, Deepchandi, Jhaptal, Trital, and Bhajani. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach with Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), our model efficiently dissects and categorizes these intricate rhythmic patterns. The system, trained on a set of Classical Indian Music recordings, offers a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to upload audio files, providing easy recognition of tabla taals.
